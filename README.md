## Installation

1. Clone the repo and 
2. Run the index.html file in default browser.


## Usage 

This daily scheduler was designed to run in the browser. It retrieves information from Moment.js, a third party api, and uses its' data to give color-coded information. The user's input saves to local storage which updates the page in real time. It was also designed to meet the criteria for GT Full-stack Flex program homework requirements. 

It is built using DOM manipulation techniques in Javascript and customized based on acceptance criteria provided in class.
